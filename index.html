                            Engineering. Thus, research was one of my main focuses for my freshman year. After applying to multiple
                            projects through the University of Michigan UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program), I was able
                            to finally find a project when I directly emailed Professor Henry Sodano. Under Professsor Henry Sodano,
                            I'm currently working as an undergraduate research assistant for Ph.D. Candidate Steven Mamolo. I'm aiming
                            to start my own materials-related research project later this year.

                            an initial interest meeting, I knew that it would be the perfect job for me this year. The Michigan Engineering
                            Zone focuses on mentoring FRC teams in Detroit. We help them learn and understand all facets of FRC robotics,
                            including build, design, programming, rules, etc. First Robotics was something that I was especially passionate 
                            about in high school, so I'm lucky that I was able to find MEZ this year and be hired as a mentor.

                            roles in these different organizations. At CFTB, I recycled and refurbished computers, working with 
                            different computer hardware components and troubleshooting computer software problems to provide easy computer
                            access to the visually impaired. At the Perot Museum, I encouraged individuals, especially those of 
                            the younger generation, to get involved in and be exicted about STEM topics. At the North Texas Food Bank,
                            I was responsible for sorting and packaging food items for those who needed it.
